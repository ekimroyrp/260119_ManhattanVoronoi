# 260119_ManhattanVoronoi

260119_ManhattanVoronoi is a focused project to explore Manhattan-distance Voronoi diagrams, capturing the geometry, algorithms, and visual outputs around L1 metric partitions.

## Features
- Manhattan (L1) Voronoi diagram exploration and reference implementation
- Reproducible inputs and outputs for testing and comparison
- Clear, minimal structure for adding generators, renderers, and experiments

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project folder in your editor.
3. Run the generator or scripts once they are added to produce outputs.

## Controls
- None yet. Controls and run commands will be documented as they are implemented.
